# Description

Allows snippets of HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS to be created; an alternative to using a functions.php file or adding styles to a child theme.

Snippets can be used to create re-usable HTML or JavaScript snippets or to create PHP to add_actions or add_filters without needing to add them to the functions.php file or create a plugin.

The following types of snippet can be created:
* HTML - can be loaded using the shortcode.
* Internal CSS - automatically added as internal stylesheet.
* CSS Stylesheet - automatically loaded.
* Internal JavaScript - automatically added as internal JavaScript.
* JavaScript File - automatically loaded.
* PHP - can be loaded using the shortcode.
* PHP File - automatically loaded.

Shortcode usage is either `[snippet id=1013]` (where the supplied id value is a snippet post_id) or `[snippet slug='hello-world']`.

All snippets are loaded only on the site frontend; this protects the admin dashboard from white screen errors caused by badly formed PHP.
